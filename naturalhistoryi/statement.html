	The <i>Natural History I</i> series developed from research investigating the roles of academic institutions in the colonization and exploitation of non-western cultures. These photos, selected from over 150 similar images, are sourced from the digital collection archives of the <a href="https://peabody.yale.edu/" target="_blank">Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History</a> and the <a href="https://naturalhistory.si.edu/" target="_blank">Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History</a>. The images were taken by scientists during field research and collection expeditions in the coastal African countries of Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. Birds pictured were later killed, preserved, and brought to the American museumsâ€™ collections facilities.
