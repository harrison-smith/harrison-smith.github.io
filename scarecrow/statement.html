	In the <i>Scarecrow</i> series, young Black men were polled for anecdotes of racial profiling 
	in Pittsburgh, PA and New Haven, CT. Life-size scarecrows were dressed in clothing 
	sourced from the artist and contributors, and placed in the locations anecdotally 
	described. The series acknowledges and builds on the historic use of scarecrows in 
	popular media to present stereotypic depictions of Black men by re-appropriating the 
	reference as a symbol of Black men's discomfort, alienation, and fears.
