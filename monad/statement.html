	In 1714 Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz published <i>Monadology</i>, a philosophical treatise arguing the existence of “monads,” indivisible units composing all matter in the universe, each with a unique predetermined course of action and interaction. These units, he suggested, are constantly developing, changing and interacting, such that from the condition of a single monad the state of the entire universe may theoretically be determined. Though deeply rooted in the theological, philosophical, and early scientific knowledge of its time, Leibniz’s theory proved to be exceedingly salient as quantum mechanics advancements of the 20th century refined our knowledge of the physical universe.

By uncovering the component parts of the neutron and proton, quantum scientists displaced these particles with quarks, the new indivisible ingredient of everything. These smaller and more mysterious particles demonstrate behavior unlike anything observed before, best exemplified by a property physicists have termed “quantum entanglement”: the interaction between or generation of particles such that their essential being becomes super-materially linked. Once entangled, actions on a particle can determine the behavior of its quantum pair across space and time––particles in Switzerland react instantaneously to the experiences of their pair in America, electrons in the present determine the behavior of their quantum pair yesterday. Scientists have provided the only explanation possible: quantum pairs do not break the rules of physics because they are not, in fact, two separate particles at all. The quantum” pair” actually describes a single entity, existing simultaneously within and beyond our spatial-mechanical perception of it. Furthermore, these entanglements are always happening. Our universe is not composed of myriad distinct entities, rather, it is a complex and perpetually mutating mass of intra-dependent being(s). And just like that, Leibniz’s monad became a reality.

But what happens to our understanding of being and self when these physics disrupt our most basal rules of existence? When the discrete is exploded into everything, how are we to distinguish between an apple and orange, water and oil, presence and void? Dichotomous objects become physically intertwined and interdependent beyond the limits of our perception. But, most importantly, what do these realizations mean from an explicitly social perspective? As suggested by historian, philosopher, and feminist scholar Karen Barad, quantum mechanics demands we reconsider the foundation of not only or physical being, but the moral fabric of existence as well. When time and space break down, and “you,” “I,” and “them” are one in the same, what we owe to ourselves we also owe everyone and everything.

On the night of July 8th, 2019 I stumbled across a box on the street in Tucson, Arizona, and was immediately stopped in my tracks. The box seemed to resonate with a frequency I could not ignore. Before the inkjet-signs were affixed to its side, the empty box had been turned upside down. On top of the box sat a rock, causing the corrugated base to sag under its weight. The cardboard box, responding to its dry and windy environment, wanted to move. The rock, responding to the gravity dominating its own existence, resisted this movement and fixed the box in place. The signs advertised an estate sale, suggesting death–––spiritual movement into the beyond, as well as the human movement of those left behind; a very different kind of movement than that of the pair’s materiality. These relationships had palpable weight, but I could only perceive that weight, and nothing beyond. What relationship do I have to the material pair? And, through that pair or otherwise, what relationship to I have to the people whose lives it points towards? Staring at the box, I’d become entangled in a network of relations I could never fully know. Since the summer of 2019, I have been recreating the Tucson box to the best of my ability, trying to reconcile with an object that has formed one of an infinite amount of quantum pairs in which I will participate beyond the rest of my life.
