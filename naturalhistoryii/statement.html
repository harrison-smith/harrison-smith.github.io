	The <i>Natural History II</i> series, completed in collaboration with <a href="http://www.jonocoles.com" target="_blank">Jono Coles</a>, addresses dialogues around ancestry by considering the relationships between people, place, heritage, and cultural ownership. Materials were collected from an acre of woods near our homes in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Elaborate animal traps were constructed based on designs associated with our ancestral cultures, only to be disassembled and documented using the visual language of anthropological collection archives. The project investigates the relationship between place and people through the use of natural materials to simultaneously reference a specific physical site and visually evoke historic human culture. By <i>i)</i> responding to the collection and classification of non-western cultural objects as “natural history” artifacts by museums, and <i>ii)</i> reenacting the processes of capture, destruction, and documentation, we also aim to underscore the role of these institutions in the violent obfuscation and erasure of the histories their collected objects represent.
