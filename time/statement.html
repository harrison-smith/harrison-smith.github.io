	This work was constructed as a means to study time and memory through content and 
	material. The work prominently features a portrait of my Grandmother, a retired 
	teacher who now suffers from dementia. The study also includes a portrait of Jean Arp, 
	whose career may be divided into two periods. During the first Arp used archival 
	materials with the goal of constructing works that would physically endure. In the 
	second period, Arpâ€™s goals shifted to an exploration of the ephemeral.
