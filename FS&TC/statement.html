On January 16, 1865, Union General William T. Sherman issued Special Field Order No. 15, which authorized the redistribution of White-owned land south of Charleston, South Carolina to Black freedmen. <a id="ua1">T</a>hough this order is remembered as the federal government’s first attempt at reparations, the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Land was only authorized to distribute property following a lease-to-own model that charged market rates and gave Black renters no equity in the land — prefiguring racialized predatory lending practices of the 20th and 21st centuries.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <a id="ua2">F</a>ollowing President Abraham Lincoln’s assassination in April of 1865, President Andrew Johnson issued an amnesty proclamation that effectively repealed Special Field Order No. 15.<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>
</br></br>
<a id="ua3">I</a>n response to the failure of Sherman’s order, reformers championed the new Freedman’s Savings and Trust Company as a secure way for emancipated Black Americans to save towards land ownership.<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> The Freedman’s Bank, as the company became known, had been chartered by Congress on March 3rd alongside the Freedmen’s Bureau and was left untouched by the Johnson administration after Lincoln’s death. <a id="ua4">E</a>stablished under an all-White board three years prior to the 14th Amendment, the Freedman’s Bank was explicitly designed to provide Black people with low-risk, stable returns at a time when they were legally prohibited from accessing “White” commercial banks.<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup>
</br></br>
<a id="ua5">G</a>alvanized by the elusive promise of land ownership, account holders quickly accumulated; within 8 years the bank had branches in 15 states and the District of Columbia, and served over 60,000 depositors.<sup><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup> <a id="ua6">F</a>lush with capital and faced with growing expenses, bank leadership resolved to act against the regulations of their charter and began investing in high-risk railroad securities and real estate in the winter of 1869.<sup><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup> In March of 1870, buoyed by high initial returns on investments, Congress amended the bank’s charter to allow the investment of half of all deposits in real estate-backed bonds and loans. Following this amendment, the bank’s finance committee began liberally skirting other regulations in its charter and used the institution to fund their own private ventures with personal loans and investments in worthless securities. <a id="ua7">W</a>hen the Panic of 1873 reached America and the railroad market collapsed, the overexposed Freedman’s Bank failed.<sup><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup> It officially shuttered in 1874, having gambled away the wealth of Black depositors across the United States. Expenditures associated with the distribution of final dividends left even less for account holders, who in the end received no more than 64 percent of their total savings. The Freedman’s Savings and Trust Company collapse constituted the first nation-wide economic expropriation of Black people following emancipation.
</br></br>
This final dividend check, issued in 1883 by the bank’s Savannah, Georgia branch, was donated by artist Harrison Kinnane Smith to the Savannah Community Land Trust, a non-profit organization designed to remove land from the real estate market and provide "long-term affordable housing" to Savannah communities at risk of gentrification and “unfair financial practices." A stewardship agreement signed by Smith and the Trust entitles the artist to hold and manage the artwork on the nonprofit’s behalf. As a steward, Smith generates revenue for the Trust by advertising the check through a lease-to-own contract modeled on land titles issued in 1865 by the Freedmen’s Bureau to newly-emancipated Black Americans. Prospective buyers are forced to rent the work, which is ultimately reappropriated by the artist on behalf of the Trust, leaving each collector with only the contracts articulating this denial of ownership.
