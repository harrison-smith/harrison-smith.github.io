On September 11th, 2001, the United States Border Patrol broke ground on construction of a new station in Alpine, Texas, about 85 miles north of the US-Mexico border. Midway through the groundbreaking ceremony, word of the 9/11 terrorist attacks reached the station. <a id="ua1">T</a>he event was canceled and all agents were put on high alert.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>
</br></br>

In response to the 9/11 attacks, Congress passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The act outlined creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which was formally established in March of the following year. <a id="ua2">T</a>he structural reorganization of governmental departments and agencies undertaken to form DHS represents the United States’ largest bureaucratic restructuring since WWII.<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> In this reshuffling, Border Patrol — formerly managed by the Department of Justice’s now defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) — was relocated under Customs and Border Protection (CBP), a division of the new DHS.
</br></br>

<a id="ua3">P</a>rior to its dissolution, the INS’ mission was “to carry out national policy which provides for selective immigration and for controlled entry and stay of nonimmigrants in order to promote the reunification of families, entry of immigrants possessing needed skills, temporary admission of specific classes of noncitizens, and refuge from persecution.”<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> <a id="ua4">I</a>n contrast, the CBP website states “Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the focus of the Border Patrol has changed to detection, apprehension and/or deterrence of terrorists and terrorist weapons.”<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <a id="ua5">A</a><a id="ua6">l</a>ongside their revised mandate, Border Patrol experienced dramatic growth: the agency’s annual budget went from $1.146B in 2001 to $7.153B in 2023;<sup><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup> meanwhile staffing in the Big Bend sector, home to the Alpine station, increased from 194 agents in 2001 to 540 in 2020.<sup><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup>
</br></br>

The political response to 9/11 effectively completed the US border’s transformation from a site of bureaucratic exclusion into a war zone. <a id="ua7">I</a>n this evolution, Border Patrol agents formerly tasked with managing commerce and reuniting families became soldiers in the parallel “wars” on drugs and terror — even in the Big Bend sector, which sees only 1% of the agency’s “encounters” on the country’s Southwestern border.<sup><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup>
</br></br>

On August 6th, 2011, two Alpine Border Patrol agents returned to Texas from New York City. The flatbed truck they drove carried a 1,300-pound steel beam collected from the wreckage of the World Trade Center. <a id="ua8">T</a>he beam’s arrival was the product of a 10 month long application process undertaken by Alpine Border Patrol agents with the New York Port Authority.<sup><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup> <a id="ua9">U</a>sing their personal resources, active and retired agents of the Big Bend region then collaborated in designing and building a memorial from the debris.<sup><a href="#fn9">9</a></sup> The twisted beam is now installed as a public monument outside Alpine’s Border Patrol station. <a id="ua10">A</a>t its unveiling in 2011, then Deputy Chief Benjamine Huffman said, “we feel we have somewhat of an emotional investment in this piece and what it means to us, our agency and this community.”<sup><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup>
