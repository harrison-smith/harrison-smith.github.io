<i>Rejection, Redaction, Redirection: <a href="http://www.jonocoles.com" target="_blank">Jono Coles</a> and Harrison Smith's The Deposition</i> is a creative essay written in collaboration with Jono Coles that critically interrogates institutional accountability using the authors’ relationships to the Guggenheim, the <a id="ua1">S</a>ackler family,<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> and Purdue Pharma as a case study. The work was completed as the authors' contribution to the inaugural Guggenheim Summer Practicum and was inspired by the recovery of Coles’ mother from opioid use disorder.
<br><br>

<a id="ua2">F</a>or a decade following Purdue's 1995 release of OxyContin, the Sackler-owned company engaged in a number of deceptive marketing strategies that misrepresented the drug as non-addictive and more broadly applicable than had been determined to be safe.<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> The resultant reckless over-prescription of OxyContin fueled what is now known as the “opioid epidemic.”<a id="ua3"> </a>Between 1999 and 2017, annual opioid-related deaths in America rose from approximately 6,400 to over 47,000.<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a><a id="ua4"></sup> </a><a id="ua5">D</a>uring that same time period, OxyContin sales produced over $32 billion in profits.<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a>,<a href="#fn5">5</a></sup> By distributing a portion of these profits in philanthropic donations, the Sackler family embroiled a number of renowned art institutions in their ethical transgressions.<a id="ua6"> </a>Between 1995 and 2015, the Guggenheim museum accepted $9 million in donations from Mortimer D. Sackler and kin, and awarded his son a position on the museum’s board of trustees from 2003 to 2018.<sup><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup> No public apology has been issued by Purdue Pharma or the Sackler family for their role in the opioid crisis, or the Guggenheim museum for their complicity.
<br><br> 

<a id="ua7">T</a>To address this absence of atonement and speculate on its significance, <i>Rejection, Redaction, Redirection</i> analyzes a video artwork titled <i>The Deposition</i>, originally conceived of as the authors’ contribution to the practicum.<sup><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup> The video work — which was rejected by the Guggenheim for logistical, legal and financial reasons — explores identity, responsibility, and corporate personhood by using deepfake technology to disguise Coles as patriarch Richard Sackler in his only public statement on Purdue’s relationship to the opioid epidemic. By analyzing <i>The Deposition</i> video, this creative essay circumnavigated the museum’s imposed creative restrictions, while positioning an assessment of the Guggenheim’s relation to the Sacklers as necessary to realize the practicum’s goal of imagining “a sustainable future.” By reflexively focusing our work on the Guggenheim, this essay aims to critically consider “What might real institutional accountability look like?”

<sup>1</sup> In accordance with a legal agreement between the Sackler family and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, all mentions of the Sackler name were originally to be censored in the museum’s publication of this piece. Thanks to the dedicated advocacy of Guggenheim Summer Practicum mentors, the museum decided to break this agreement and publish the work in its uncensored form. <sup><a href="#ua1">↑</a></sup>
