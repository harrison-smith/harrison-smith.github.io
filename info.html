	Harrison Kinnane Smith is an artist and writer. In his research-based practice, Smith highlights racialized systems of power by exploring the interactions between material systems (ecologies, commercial networks) and immaterial structures (policies, financial systems, popular culture). His current research is supported by the Advancing Black Arts in Pittsburgh Program, a partnership of The Pittsburgh Foundation and The Heinz Endowments. Smith splits his time between Pittsburgh, PA and Hartford, CT, where he works as an editor of the Bunker Review and an Arts Fellow at Trinity College.
