<a id="ua1">F</a>rom 1846-1848 the United States waged its first war of aggression with a European-descendant nation, the Mexican-American War.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> <a id="ua2">T</a>he conflict ended on February 2, 1848 with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which outlined Mexico’s forfeiture of present-day Utah, Nevada, California and parts of Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico.<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> The treaty required the United States to honor and protect the property interests of Mexican citizens in these territories.<br><br>

<a id="ua3">C</a>alifornia had been the territory of European nations since 1542, according to the Catholic Church’s “Doctrine of Discovery,” which granted the kings of Portugal and Spain religious authority to claim lands occupied by non-Christians “upon arrival.”<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup> After Mexico gained independence in 1821, the new government redistributed Californian lands held by Franciscan missions and expanded the Spanish rancho land grant system by allocating thousands of acres of indigenous land to settlers. <a id="ua4">R</a>ancho Topanga Malibu Sequit, encompassing present-day Malibu and inhabited by the Indigenous Chumash peoples, was granted in a concession to Jose Bartolome Tapia in 1800.<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup> <a id="ua5">R</a>ancho San José de Buenos Aires, inhabited by the Indigenous Tongva peoples and including the lands currently occupied by the University of California, Los Angeles, was granted in a concession to Máximo Alanis in 1843.<sup><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup> <a id="ua6">I</a>t was these Mexican rancho grants that the U.S. was required by treaty to uphold.<sup><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup> However, Mexican records were a “maze of inchoate, incomplete, conditional, inexactly surveyed” claims. <a id="ua7">T</a>he obligation to uphold these claims against the influx of settlers to California during the Gold Rush presented the United States with the challenge of distinguishing between California’s public and private lands, and assimilating the unorganized Mexican recording system into the U.S.’s favored title registry form in order to arbitrate competing land claims made by American squatters and <i>rancho</i> titleholders.<sup><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup><br><br>

California was granted statehood in September of 1850. The following spring, Congress passed the California Land Act of 1851, which created a Board of Land Commissioners to adjudicate claims to Mexican ranchos. <a id="ua8">C</a>laimants were required to file titles with the Commission, which supplemented vague Mexican deeds with reports from American surveyors.<sup><a href="#fn8">8</a></sup> <a id="ua9">I</a>n 1853, Congress created a U.S. Surveyor General position for California alongside an affiliate land office, which worked to systematize land records in the state.<sup><a href="#fn9">9</a></sup><br><br>

When Mexican titles were upheld by the Land Commissioners and federal courts, the rulings expanded the property rights titleholders. <a id="ua10">I</a>n a series of 1850s rulings, the Supreme Court allowed owners to subdivide and sell their plots and in 1859 the California Supreme Court affirmed the mineral rights of landholders whose titles originated in Mexican ranchos — all powers withheld under the Mexican legal system.<sup><a href="#fn10">10</a></sup><br><br>

<a id="ua11">M</a>aps provided by government surveyors to the Board of Land Commissioners were essential in the gradual verification of poorly-recorded Mexican claims, just as the Board of Land Commissioners’ rulings on claims to private land allowed government surveyors to create increasingly accurate maps outlining the state’s public lands.<sup><a href="#fn11">11</a></sup> <a id="ua12">A</a>fter the two-year claims window closed, all Mexican and Spanish titles that were not brought before the Commission became public land.<sup><a href="#fn12">12</a></sup> <a id="ua13">O</a>nce the government identified public tracts, the U.S. Surveyor General was authorized to offer this land to squatters or sell it at auction.<sup><a href="#fn13">13</a></sup><br><br>

One of the California government's primary projects in the 1850s was to develop and populate the state with American citizens whom it could regulate and tax. Regulation required an understanding of who owned what (as articulated in title registries) and where (as determined by survey). The government accomplished this in part through “preemption” and the auction of public lands.<br><br>

The doctrine of preemption allowed squatters who settled on and “improved” unsurveyed land to purchase plots at significantly discounted rates before they were offered in public auction. Preemption’s few conditions required squatters to perform an informal survey of the land, which was then assimilated into the state's records. The improvement requirement of preemption and survey requirement for all unsurveyed land sales ensured that the state’s distribution of titles to squatters increased its proportion of economically productive land while expanding local title registries and their associated tax bases.<br><br>

The acquisition and populating of California by American settlers, investors, and capitalists both catalyzed and was facilitated by what is now known as the California Genocide. <a id="ua14">B</a>etween 1846 and 1873 Indigenous communities in California were reduced by 80%. In addition to materially expanding the lands available for settlement through physical violence, U.S. military and militia campaigns also indirectly encouraged legal strategies of displacement.<sup><a href="#fn14">14</a></sup> <a id="ua15">P</a>ublic acknowledgment of the mass killing of Native people served to foment popular support among non-Indians for displacement through legal means, which was accepted as the only alternative to outright extermination.<sup><a href="#fn15">15</a></sup> Among Indigenous people, subjection to continued de jure and extra-judicial enslavement and targeted killings incentivized participation in any agreement that might secure legal protections. <a id="ua16">N</a>egotiations between 1851 and 1853 ultimately secured Indian forfeiture of approximately one third of the entire state of California in return for U.S. Congress’ allocation of roughly 0.125% of the state for Indian reservations.<sup><a href="#fn16">16</a></sup><br><br>

<a id="ua17">I</a>n the years immediately following the U.S. accession of California, organized racial violence, private and government surveyors, the Board of Land Commissioners, and state-appointed treaty negotiators transitioned California from a territory of ambiguous settler claims and legally vacant land into a uniform system defined by the absence of Indigenous peopls and the ubiquity of titles bestowing near-total property rights to European-descendant landowners.<sup><a href="#fn17">17</a></sup><br><br>

On March 12, 2012, the City of Malibu passed Ordinance No. 361, adding “Chapter 17.45: Citywide View Preservation and Restoration” to the city’s municipal code. The law allows homeowners to formally register 180º photographic documentation of “primary views” from a fixed point 60 inches above the ground, either inside their home or within a 10-foot radius of its exterior. Three months later, on June 1, 2012,  Malibu implemented its “Story Pole Policy,” which requires the erection of poles and orange netting to outline proposed construction prior to city approval. <a id="ua18">T</a>ogether, the two codes allow primary view records to serve as a reference for the city in its regulation of view obstructions by buildings on adjacent lots, in perpetuity.<sup><a href="#fn18">18</a></sup> <a id="ua19">W</a>hen determining whether view obstructions are “significant,” Malibu planners are required to consider “the extent to which the primary view contributes to the economic value and/or enjoyment of the claimant's property.”<sup><a href="#fn19">19</a></sup><br><br>

By ensuring that “economically valuable” views are guaranteed in perpetuity, registering a primary view can be understood to increase the total value of the property. Ironically, this increase in property value is largely illegible to the LA County government, which determines the property taxes of each parcel in the county — assessors are limited by law to a maximum increase of 2% per year, unless the titleholder changes or the property undergoes new construction.<br><br>

California’s 19th century expropriation and privatization through land survey established visual documentation as a central tool in the American project of expropriation and property accumulation. Malibu’s use of visual documentation to simultaneously reinforce property values and expand regulatory power beyond the bounds of the registrant’s plot constitutes a homologous formation in which the traces of settler colonial strategies of expansion and dispossession are legible.<br><br>

     12. The challenge of surveying the expansive plots outlined in Mexican ranchos inspired technological innovations in the field of surveying. In the 1850s, private surveyor and writer William Schmolz developed a new surveyor’s transit with the explicit purpose of outlining Mexican land grants. He patented the  which he patented in 1881.

These treaties were ultimately rejected by the California legislature, which deemed the concession of 7.5% of state land to reservations too great a concession.
